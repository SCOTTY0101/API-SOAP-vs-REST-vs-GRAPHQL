Different API's. SOAP vs REST vs GRAPHQL (Lightweight http caching vs heavy data)

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol, 
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style and
GraphQL is a query language and efficently loads data from a server to a client.

SOAP INFORMATION:
SOAP has tighter security with SSL support and WS-Security.

REST INFORMATION: 
REST is all about simplicity, thanks to HTTP protocols.
Optimised for the web with JSON as its data format and excellent performance and scalability.

GRAPHQL INFORMATION:
GraphQL helps solve the problems that REST canâ€™t and won't slow down your APP.




Notes:
JSON doesn't support comments. Shows GET https://URL and GraphQL "person" errors.
VScode is TypeScript based.
