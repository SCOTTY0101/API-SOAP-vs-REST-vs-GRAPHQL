Different API's. SOAP vs REST vs GRAPHQL (Lightweight http caching vs heavy data)

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol, 
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style and
GraphQL is a query language and efficently loads data from a server to a client.

SOAP INFORMATION:
SOAP has tighter security with SSL support and WS-Security.
Only uses XML.

REST INFORMATION: 
REST is all about simplicity, thanks to HTTP protocols.
Optimised for the web with JSON as its data format and excellent performance and scalability.

GRAPHQL INFORMATION:
GraphQL helps solve the problems that REST canâ€™t and won't slow down your APP.




Notes:

JSON doesn't support comments. VScode is typescript based and throws ( GET https://URL and GraphQL "person" ) errors.
Added key vale pair to link back to the notes below to stop errors.

 graphQL object: 
 {
    person {
	  name
	  age
	  city
    }
 }

 REST request:
  GET https://www.sampleWebSiteInformation.io
